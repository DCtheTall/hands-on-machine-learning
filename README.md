This repository is my notes and exercise solutions while I was reading
_Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow_ by Aurélian Géron.
All of the code and notes are written in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
notebooks that are written to run in
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
